# CRWN Clothing E-commerce App

## Description

I'm taking a course that focuses on developing the back end of a full-stack application using Node.js and Express.js. The project I'm building in the course can be seen [here](https://github.com/JSulley/nasa-project).

The front end leverages React and is built with Create React App. Even though React is not the focus of the aforementioned project, it's definitely beneficial to see how both ends connect and understand how React works. Therefore, I decided to take the Complete React Developer: Zero to Mastery, where this project is from (see [Credits](#credits) for more information).

The project goal: to build an E-commerce app for CRWN Clothing Ltd. where users can make an account and purchases.

So far, I've learned
- React fundamentals (e.g., state, components (functional vs. class), HTML vs. JSX)
- How React works (e.g. DOM and VirtualDOM, unilateral data flow, props, component lifecycle)

My personal goals are
- to expose myself to different front-end technologies (such as SCSS)
- to learn how Create React App facilitates the front-end development process
